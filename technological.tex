\chapter{Technological Aspects}
To be able to understand the technological aspects of this game and the game's potential, we will look into what video games are and the use of this kind of games today. In addition, we will describe exergames and different technologies related to this topic, to make a brief evaluation of Cyberlab's choice of technology. \\ \\ 
First we will describe video games and exergames. We will then look at some related work where training and video gaming are brought together. Finally, we will evaluate the different technologies and provide a recommendation.\\ \\
(To be able to understand the overall picture of the game Cyberlab is going to develop; how the game can and should be developed; what kind of technology should be used: how it can work as a substitute to an exercise program or an additional offering and how this can work in an existing physiotherapist service, we have to describe each of the entities alone.\\ \\ In this chapter we will describe what video games, and in general exergames, are, the different type of exergames relevant for Cyberlab's game and at last we will bring fall prevention and rehabilitation together with exercise games by looking at some previous research.

\section{Computer and Video Games}
"Video games are electronic, interactive games known for their vibrant colors, sound effects, and complex graphics" \cite{videogamedef}. Characters or objects are controlled by hand held game controllers, or by pure body movement captured by sensors or motion controllers. Since the first computer game was developed in 1952 there has been a tremendous evolution in the computer and video game market. Todays market consist of an endless amount of various computer games, video games and video game consoles, and this type of technology are widely used all over the world. It has been developed a game for almost every need and interest, and video games are used for many different purposes, like education and learning, exercising or just pure entertainment. In this section we will describe the history of computer and video games, and gaming statistics. \\ \\
The first graphical computer game was created by A.S. Douglas in 1952. This single-player "game" was based on a version of Tic-Tac-Toe and the title of the game was "OXO". "OXO" was designed for academic purposes.  Douglas wrote a PhD degree on Human-Computer interaction, and used feedback from the electronic "OXO" in his work \cite{abouthiginbotham}. Ralph Baer, a German-born television engineer, designed in 1967 the first video game console for use on standard television. "Chase" was the name of the game, and here two players were connected to a television where they controlled two squares which they used to chase each other \cite{videogameHistory}. Various features were added to this idea, and this ended up in 12 games known as the Brown Box. Baer introduced his idea to Magnavox, and in 1972 the first commercial video game called Magnavox Odyssey was produced. TV dealers did not see the potential in the Odyssey, so it did not get very popular, and the market experienced low sales numbers. In 1985 the first Nintendo Entertainment System was released. Retailers were sceptical to marketing a new console soon after the video-game crash, but the games Nintendo introduced got popular, and soon Nintendo broke sale records and become the best-selling console in video-game history \cite{consoleHistory}. \\ \\
The Nintendo Wii is one of many gaming consoles, and it is worldwide very popular. It has sold over 30 million units in the US and in Japan there has been sold almost 10 million. These numbers combined with the international market gives a total sale of Nintendo Wii of 65.32 million units. However, the bestselling console ever is the Sony PlayStation 2, with over 138 million units sold. The bestselling video game series is the Mario franchise, with a sales number of over 225 million games \cite{statistics2012}.

DFC Intelligence is a marked research and consulting firm which focus on interactive entertainment and game markets. The global market for video games experienced revenue of 67 billion dollars in 2012, and in DFC Intelligence's new reports they forecast that the global video game market is expected to reach 82 billion dollars in 2017. This number includes revenue from console hardware and software, PC games and games for mobile devices \cite{videogameforcast} \cite{aboutdfcint}. \\ \\
In the last 30 years there has been a great evolution in video games. Video games have become widespread entertainment, and in the US 65 percent of all households play video games. The majority of these gamers are players in the age of 18-49, and today the average age for a US gamer is 32 years old. In 2010 the average gamer played video games 8 hours during a week, and in 2012 this is more than doubled, when gamers today spends 18 hours a week playing video games.  \cite{statistics2010} \cite{statistics2012} \\ \\
A surprising fact about the gaming statistics in the US is that as much as 2 out of 5 gamers are women, and that there are more gamers over 50 than there are gamers under 18, se figure \ref{fig:GamersUSNorway} \cite{statistics2012}. "Norsk mediebarometer", a report containing statistics around the topic of media use in Norway, show that 17 percent of the Norwegian population plays computer or video games on an average day in 2011. This includes not only children and teenagers; also a great part of elderly has started to use computer or video games. 8 percent of the population in the age 45 - 79 years use this kind of technologies on an average day, see Figure \ref{fig:GameStatisticsNorway}, where females are the most active gamers. The US has a higher number of gamers over 50, but the statistics shows that use of computer and video game in Norway has increased from 5 percent in 2010 and this measurement are the highest share ever recorded. \cite{ssb2010} \cite{ssb2011} One thing worth mentioning about the report of media use in Norway, is that when it came to looking at video games alone, 0 percent of the population in the age 45 - 79 said that they played video games on an average day in 2011! \cite{ssb2011}

\section{Exercise Games}
The new generation of video games that combine game play and physical activity is called exercise games, or "exergames". Exergames uses technology like motion sensors and remote control to track body movement. This requires the player to get up from the couch and physically move their body to be able to play the game, which stimulates exercise. Exergames is proved to be motivating because of its easy understanding, accessibility and fun, and it has shown promise in effecting users health in a positive direction \cite{promotingexercise}. The combination of movement, amusement and social interaction provides exergaming great potential for new business opportunities for the entertainment, recreation and healthcare sectors \cite{gamingforhealth}. \\ \\ 
Today there exist numerous types of games and technologies related to exergames, where Nintendo Wii, Dance Dance Revolution, PlayStation Eye Toy and Xbox Kinect are some of the more familiar technologies. This genre of games has become very popular, and due to the growing interests one has seen it as relevant to study the use in regard of health and education. The technology these games provide can in an interesting way help provide health-related information to specified target groups \cite{gamingforhealth}. In the past years exergames research has increased dramatically, which indicates that it will continue to do so \cite{chamberlin2008exergames}. Research shows tremendous promise in academic and physical progress of youth using exergames. Use of exergames is also an important factor to the social aspect, because of the possibility of playing with others, something that will be entertaining for elderly who are often alone and experience loneliness as a part of the everyday life \cite{exergamesforelderly}. The feeling of accomplishment users get from reaching goals, completing exercises and being in physical activity increases the users mood \cite{staiano2011exergames}. This combined with the social interaction you get from playing provides a desire to play again \cite{exergamesforelderly} \cite{staiano2011exergames}. The health sector is now more focused on prevention of illness instead of treatment, where this type of research can contribute to use of exergames in health care \cite{gamingforhealth}. Exergames has shown promise in rehabilitation of balance after stroke and damage to the spine. Exergame can also be appropriate to use for exercising and in rehabilitation. The fun and challenges you get through the game could take the focus away from boredom and physical pain \cite{exergamesforelderly} \cite{lange2011development}. Games like Wii Sports and Dance Dance Revolution were designed to encourage physical activity, but many currently available exergames were not designed for this purpose. Few commercial games are suitable for the focused, controlled exercise required for therapy \cite{lange2011development}. Games existing today are too complicated, too rapidly and too difficult to handle for the elderly, and they have too complex and cumbersome consoles \cite{exergamesforelderly}. However, the popularity of exergames and the increasing customer appeal will improve design principles and physical requirements in the future\cite{chamberlin2008exergames}. \\ \\
We will now describe some of the different video game consoles that can be used for exergaming.
\subsection{Dance Dance Revolution}
\ac{ddr} is a series of video games created by Konami Corporationâ€™s Bemani music games division. \ac{ddr} is a rhythmic dance simulation game and was first released as an arcade game in 1998. In few years it became very popular, and the game has had its appearance on several game console systems like Sony PlayStation, Nintendo 64, Microsoft Xbox and Nintendo GameCube \cite{bogost2005rhetoric}. DDR uses a touch-sensitive dance pad with sensors to register movements, where one shall press the right sensors in proper time with electronic dance music. Arrows on-screen gives direction on how and when to move around. The DDR games have varying difficulty, requiring different levels of physical activity. GetUpMove.com is an information website about the use of PlayStation Dance Dance Revolution as a weight loss tool. This site was launched in 2004, and one of the highlighted stories was about a young woman who lost about 95 pounds by using DDR as an exercise tool. This and similar stories got widespread exposure, and consumers started to buy DDR solely for the purpose of exercise \cite{bogost2005rhetoric}. In 2003, 5 years after the first release, Konami announce that DDR has reached a total sale of 6,5 million units worldwide \cite{gamespot}. 8 years later, in 2011, the number of sold units had reached over 13 million, which is  about 1 million units sold every year since the first release in 1998 \cite{gaygamer}. 

\subsection{PlayStation EyeToy}
In the early 2000s the PlayStation 2 EyeToy was released by Sony Inc. It was the first in this category of games to introduce a device that could translate human motions into a controller input and allow players to physically interact with virtual objects using their own body and without being connected to wires. Human body movements are translated real-time into the controller input by a USB camera  and can also map the playerâ€™s face onto in-game characters. Eye Toy is easy to set up and its applications offer a lot of different environment and can be played by one or more players. \cite{eyetoy}

\subsection{PlayStation Move}
PlayStation Move was released in September 2010. The PlayStation Moveâ€™s interface consists of the Move Eye, a RGB camera with directive microphones, and the Motion Controller, a wand with an illuminating sphere attached to it. The camera can detect the sphere and determine where the wand is, which allows the players to interact with the game through motion and position. The sphere attached to the wand helps the camera to determine the distance from the wand to the camera and to track the controllers position in three dimensions. The wand is equipped with a three-axis accelerometer and a three-axis gyro sensor which are used to track rotation in overall motion and can also be used to detect if the wand is out of range (i.e. hidden behind the player back). \cite{comparison} Up to four wands are supported at one time, which makes it possible for four players to play together. The color of the sphere can be changed to any color and is usually used to show which player is active and to give visual feedback \cite{ppmove}. The SDK is not made public, so its difficult for a third party to make original applications \cite{comparison}. 

\subsection{Nintendo Wii}
Nintendo Wii was released in 2006 as the first motion sensor game. Only one year and 20 million units sold later, it became the market leader of that times generation of consoles. It consists of a Wii remote, which is the primary controller and a secondary controller called Nunchuk. The Nunchuk is connected at the bottom of the Wii remote control \cite{hackingwii}. The Wii remote contains 12 buttons, a 3-axis accelerometer, a high-resolution highspeed IR camera, a speaker, a vibration motor, and wireless Bluetooth connectivity.
The IR camera is placed on the remote's tip and can track up to four simultaneous IR light with high resolution and high speed. The accelerometer within the remote control provides the Wi remoteâ€™s motion-sensing capability. The 12 buttons on the remote are arranged symmetric so that both hands can be utilized. A vibrator motor, LED lights and a small speaker are used for different kinds of user feedback, like varying light strength and sound-effects. The four LED lights are also used to indicate the different players' ID. Communication is sent over the wireless Bluetooth connections, which enables up to four controllers to be connected at the same time.  The users of Nintendo Wii can make their own personal profile, called Mii, where the data of the player will be directly connected up on the remote used  \cite{hackingwii} \cite{whatiswii}. By December 2010 over 75 million Wii consoles were sold.  To complete the original system with improved accuracy and response time, Nintendo made an enhanced version, Wii Motion Plus, which was released in November 2009 \cite{consoles}. There are several SDKs for Nintendo Wii open, which makes it possible for a third party to develop applications which utilize the controller \cite{comparison}. 

\subsection{Wii Fit Plus}
Wii Fit Plus is a video game created for the Wii console. One of its main add-on accessories is the Wii Balance Board. The board can read your body movements and give them back on the screen as you are playing, by the use of multiple pressure sensors contained in the board \cite{whatiswiifit}. The board has a area of 55,1 cm {*} 31,6 cm. A third party can also build applications for the balance board using the SDK WiimoteLib \cite{comparison}. It has been shown that game-based balance programs like Wii Balance Board compared to traditional training is easier, more motivating and more enjoyable \cite{taylor2011activity}.

\subsection{Microsoft Kinect for Xbox 360 and Windows}
Microsoft Kinect was released in 2010 and became quickly extremely popular. Only 25 days after its release it had sold 2.5 million units and by January 2012 Xbox 360 had sold over 66 million consoles and more than 18 million Kinect motion sensors \cite{consoles} \cite{kinectsold}. Kinect is a flexible low-cost motion sensor that can track human motions and it can be used with the Xbox 360 game console or with a Windows machine.  The sensor is webcam-based, which enables the user to play and interact with the game without physically holding a sensor device. Instead the player can interact with the game console through a natural user interface by moving their body and by using voice commands. The device have the ability to give full-body 3D motion capture capabilities and gesture recognition by help of its RGB camera and depth sensor \cite{kinect}. One advantage with Kinect is that it has an interface that senses players various motions and it also senses other objects in the field, which makes a natural environment where the players can interact with virtual objects in the real world. \cite{comparison}. The Kinect sensor for Windows is designed to operate on computer running Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows Embedded Standard 7, and Windows Embedded POSReady 7. All the users need is the Kinect sensor, a computer and a Kinect for Windows application. Kinect for Windows SDK was released in June 2011 and enables developers to build Kinect applications with C++, C\# or Visual Basic using Microsoft Visual Studio 2010. This enables any third party to develop Kinect for Windows applications. \cite{kinectwindows}.\\ \\
In the next section, we will look at some research done with the use of the different technologies just describe for exercise. resultsrelated....

\section{Using Exergames for Fall Prevention and Rehabilitation: A background Study}
There has been done numerous of research on the use of video games for exercise and rehabilitation. The focus are mainly on the physical, social and cognitive benefits. In this section we will review some of the interesting findings we did with emphasis on the physical and psychological benefits. The physical part includes both "normal" exercise and rehabilitation. The social benefits are important aspects for the target group of Cyberlab's exergame, because they are people that may not have that much social interactions, often because they are afraid of leaving own house. The research review provided here, will also relate to the previous described different technologies.\\ \\
Taylor et al. \cite{taylor2011activity} did a review on different studies related to gaming systems in exercise and rehabilitation. We will summarize some of their interesting findings here. From the studies they reviewed they found a trend; the  \ac{ee} while playing Wii was greater than when doing sedentary activities, but not greater than brisk walking. This suggests that playing Wii sports could not replace real sports activities. Playing \ac{ddr} on the other hand, maximum heart rate and oxygen consumption were greater compared with Wii sports, suggesting that DDR can substitute physical activity, based on \ac{ascm} guidelines for physical activity.
In their research they also found a study on what attitudes people have against \ac{ddr} to encourage exercise. 40 postmenstrual women, aged 45-75 years old were asked. The overall attitude was positive; The game was fun and it gave potential to improve coordination. However, they also expressed a concern about a long learning process. It was also found that playing against a human gave greater arousal ratings and physiological responses to gaming than when playing against a computer, which benefit the enjoyment. This aspect is important to take into consideration when setting up a gaming environment for the older population, because they may benefit from the social interaction. Some games have already shown the potential for rehabilitation , like the EyeToy and the Wii. The main resons why these type of games a suitable are that the have the ability to increase motivation and produce distraction from daily, boring and painful treatments. Wii is seen as an attractive game for rehabilitation, both at home or in institutions. Wii is actually already in use within the National Health Service in UK and is commonly used for the elderly and patients with pathologies.  \cite{taylor2011activity} \\ \\
Another study they found was that non-disabled  elderly (70 +/- 5,7 years) was positive to the EyeToy. They enjoyed it and found it easy to use. For patients with stroke it appeared to be less suitable, which could be even worse if they had to hold on to a controller, for example with Wii. This suggests that EyeToy is more suitable for patients with stroke than games with remote controllers.  
Even though these type of games are initially meant as entertainment systems, there are a number of studies that have used the hardware and developed software to turn for example the Wii into a useful rehabilitation tool. The importance of these games are entertainment that motivates for actual sports. This is very important in for example rehabilitation. \cite{taylor2011activity} \\ \\
Staiano and Calvert write about how exergames are more and more used in the health sector. Gaming consoles are already integrated into equipments at gyms and health clubs. An example is Concept 2â€™s rowing machine. Here the people exercising are motivated through competition and through virtual trainers who monitor their progress and encouraging them to proceed to the next level. Feedback from a virtual trainer is also offered in Wii Fit. Also some schools are starting to integrate games into their curriculum. In all of West Virginiaâ€™s 765 public schools they have integrated DDR in their physical education. This has proven to be very effective and popular and some students lost 5-10 pounds after playing DDR daily. \cite{staiano2011exergames}. \\ \\
Williams et al. did a study to see if exergames, more specifically Nintendo Wii Fit, was an applicable type of exercise to reduce the falling statistics of community-dwelling people over 70 years. A group who attended Wii Fit exercise sessions was compared with a group who went to a local falls group. 77 percent of the participants said that if the exercise programme was more available, people like themself would use it. 92 percent of the participants expressed that they wanted to exercise with the Wii Fit in the future, while 61 percent would choose to exercise with the Wii Fit rather than attend a falls group. An improvement in \ac{bbs}\footnote{Berg Balance Scale (BBS), a performance based measure using 14 activities of daily living (range 0-56)\cite{excell}} after 4 weeks was seen in the group that played Wii Fit, meaning that there is a potential to improve balance in this population. Despite this, there was no change in \ac{fesi})\footnote{The Falls Efficacy Scale - International (FES-I). This scale measures confidence in performing a range of activities of daily living without falling \cite{fes}} after 4 weeks. The qualitative data for the group that played Wii Fit showed improved confidence for the participants. The conclusion of the study was that Wii Fit is acceptable in  older people with a history of falls and that it has the potential to improve balance and confidence. Further work has to be done to find and develop an acceptable exercise programme with the potential to improve balance in older individuals. \cite{excell}\\ \\
Chang et al. did a study where they prototyped a Kinect game that was designed to help motivate people with motor disabilities to do their exercise more frequently and to improve the motor proficiency and quality of life. Because of the inconvenience of having to wear sensors in some of the other relevant technologies, Chang et al. chose to use Kinect. They developed a game, called "Kinerehab", that was meant to assist therapists in rehabilitating students in public school settings. To detect the studentsâ€™ movements Kinerehab uses image processing technology of Kinect. To engage and motivate the student for physical rehabilitation, the system is made with an interactive interface that has both audio and video feedback. For making it easy for therapists to review the progress of each students quickly, the system also includes details of students rehabilitation conditions which is automatically recorded in the system. Two students, a 16 year old girl diagnosed with  muscle atrophy and insufficient muscle endurance, and a 17 year old boy diagnosed with cerebral palsy, were chosen to participate in the study. The girl used a wheelchair and could only stand with assistance. The study included two phases: a baseline phase  where no assistive technology was applied, and the intervention phase where the Kinerehab was used. Both phases were done twice, beginning with the baseline phase, continuing with the intervention phase and so on. In both phases the same exercises were done. The result showed that both participants increased the number of correct movements significantly in the intervention phase. On average the number of correct movements was 49 in the first baseline phase (5 sessions), while 170 in the first intervention phase (11 sessions). Both students indicated that the game motivated them to do the exercises and that they wanted to continue using it. The therapists said it would reduce their workload a lot. This suggests that Kinect can be a viable rehabilitation tool, but further work, where more people with disabilities participate, should be done. \cite{kinect} \\ \\
From the different research we can conclude that there is a lot of attention on the use of video games as an exercise and rehabilitation tool, both for the young, and older population. The games are primarily been made for fun and entertainment and are not designed specifically for rehabilitation. There is therefore a need for customized games for this purpose. Based on the study we did on the different technologies available and the research done by others, we conclude that the Kinect sensor is a viable choice of technology for the development of an exergame for elderly. The main reason is the convenience of not having to hold on to a device. In addition it is easy to develop a game for this platform, enabled be the free SDK offered.

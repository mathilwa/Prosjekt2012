Nintendo Wii was released in 2006 as the first motion sensor game. Only one year and 20 million units sold later, it became the market leader of  that times generation of consoles. It consists of a Wii remote, which is the primary controller and a secondary controller called Nunchuk. The Nunchuk is connected at the bottom of the Wii remote control \cite{wii} \cite{hackingwii}. The Wii remote contains 12 buttons, a 3-axis accelerometer, a high-resolution highspeed IR camera, a speaker, a vibration motor, and wireless Bluetooth connectivity.
Each Wii remote has a IR camera sensor on its tip. The camera ship can track up to four simultaneous IR light with high resolution and high speed. The accelerometer within the remote control provides the Wi remoteâ€™s motion-sensing capability.The Wii remote has a total of 12 buttons and the buttons are arranged symmetric so that both hands can be utilized. A vibrator motor, LED lights and a small speaker are used for different kinds of user feedback, like varying lightstrength and sound-effects. The four LED lights are also used to indicate the different players ID. Communication is sent over the wireless Bluetooth connections, which enables up to four controllers to be connected at the same time.  The users of Nintendo Wii can make their own personal profile, called Mii, where the data of the player will be directly connected up on the remote used. To operate ,the remote needs two AA batteries \cite{hackingwii} \cite{whatiswii}.

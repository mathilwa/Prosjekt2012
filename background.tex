\subsection{PlayStation EyeToy}
In the early 2000s the PlayStation 2 EyeToy was released by Sony Inc. It was the first in this category of games to introduce a device that could translate human motions into a controller input and allow you to physically interact with virtual objects using your own body and without being connected with wires. The EyeToy is a USB camera that can track body movements and translate them into a video game \cite{eyetoy}. Human  body movements are translated real-time into the controler input by a USB camera  and can  map the player’s face onto in-game characters. Eye Toy is easy to set up and its applications offer a lot of different environment and can be played by one or more players \cite{eyetoyrehab}.

\subsection{PlayStation Move}
PlayStation 3 Move was released in September 2010. The PlayStation Move’s interface consists of the Move Eye, - a RGB camera with directive microphones,  and the Motion Controller, a wand with an illuminating sphere attached to it. The camera can detect the sphere and determine where the wand is, which allows the players to interact with the PlayStation 3 through motion and position. The sphere attached to the wand helps the camera to determine the distance from the wand to the camera and to track the controllers position in three dimensions. The wand is equipped with a three-axis accelerometer and a three-axis gyro sensor which are used to track rotation in overall motion and can also be used to detect if the wand is out of range (i.e. hidden behind the player back). It also consists of a geomagnetic sensor used to calibrate the wand’s orientation against the Earth’s magnetic field, which makes it possible to recognize the wand’s position accurately.  (hmmm... hvordan kan denne setningen skrives på en annen måte?) \cite{comparison}. Up to four wands are supported at one time, meaning that four players can play together. The color of the sphere can be changed to any color and is usually used to show what player is active and to give visual feedback \cite{ppmove}. The SDK is not made public, so its not difficult for a third-party to make original applications \cite{comparison}. 

\subsection{Nintendo Wii}
Nintendo Wii was released in 2006 as the first motion sensor game. Only one year and 20 million units sold later, it became the market leader of  that times generation of consoles. It consists of a Wii remote, which is the primary controller and a secondary controller called Nunchuk. The Nunchuk is connected at the bottom of the Wii remote control \cite{wii} \cite{hackingwii}. The Wii remote contains 12 buttons, a 3-axis accelerometer, a high-resolution highspeed IR camera, a speaker, a vibration motor, and wireless Bluetooth connectivity.
Each Wii remote has a IR camera sensor on its tip. The camera ship can track up to four simultaneous IR light with high resolution and high speed. The accelerometer within the remote control provides the Wi remote’s motion-sensing capability.The Wii remote has a total of 12 buttons and the buttons are arranged symmetric so that both hands can be utilized. A vibrator motor, LED lights and a small speaker are used for different kinds of user feedback, like varying lightstrength and sound-effects. The four LED lights are also used to indicate the different players ID. Communication is sent over the wireless Bluetooth connections, which enables up to four controllers to be connected at the same time.  The users of Nintendo Wii can make their own personal profile, called Mii, where the data of the player will be directly connected up on the remote used. To operate ,the remote needs two AA batteries \cite{hackingwii} \cite{whatiswii}. By December 2010 over 75 million Wii consoles were sold.  To complete the original system with improved accuracy and response time, Nintendo made an enhanced version, Wii Motion Plus, which was released in November 2009 \cite{consoles}.There are several SDKs for Nintendo Wii open, which makes it possible for a third party to develop applications which utilize the controller \cite{comparison}. 

\subsection{Wii Balance Board}
The Wii Balance board is an add-on accessory for the Wii Fit, which is a video game created by Nintendo to work with the Wii platform. Just like the Wii Remote controller, the balance board can read your body movements and give them back on the screen as you are playing \cite{whatiswiifit}. This measurement it gets from the multiple pressure sensors that the board contains. The board has a area of 551 mm {*} 316 mm. A third party can also build applications for the balance board usin the SDK WiimoteLib \cite{comparison}. 

\subsection{Kinect}
Microsoft Kinect was released in 2010 and became quickly extremely popular. Only 25 days after its release it had sold 2.5 million units and by January 2012 Xbox 360 had sold over 66 million consoles and more than 18 million Kinect motion sensors \cite{consoles}, \cite{kinectsold}. (With this it became the fastest selling electronic device of all times. <-huskerikke hvor jeg har funnet denne). Microsoft Kinect is a flexible low-cost motion sensor device for the Xbox 360 game console  and for Windows PCs that can track human motion. It is a webcam-based add-on peripheral for the console, which enables the user to play and interact with the game without physically holding a sensor device. Instead the player can interact with the game console through a natural user interface using gestures and voice commands (\cite{kinect}, siste setning kanskje litt avskrift.. se på senere). The device gives full-body 3D motion capture capabilities and gesture recognition by help of a RGB camera and a depth sensor \cite{kinect}. The advantages of Kinect are that it has an interface that senses players various motions and it also senses other objects in the field, which makes a natural environment where the players can interact with virtual objects in the real world. Kinect also have some limitations. Compared to Nintendo Wii and PlayStation Move Kinect's camera has a relatively low resolution of 30 Hz \cite{comparison}. Another advantage  is that its possible for a third party to write application for Kinect. Kinect for Windows SDK was released in June 2011 and enables developers to build Kinect applications with C++, C\# or Visual Basic using Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 \cite{kinectwindows}.

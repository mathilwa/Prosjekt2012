\chapter{Business Model for the Microsoft Kinect Based Exergame}
In this chapter we will use the information gathered in the previous chapters to  make an analysis of the business opportunities of the exergame. We will provide a detailed description of a business model that describes how the game should be created and delivered, and how it can create value. As a framework for this description, we will use Osterwalder's Business Model Ontology, as described in Chapter 5. At the end, we will provide a detailed financial analysis. \\ \\ 
 
\section{Product}
A product covers all aspects of what a company offers to its customers. The product is composed of value propositions, which are services and values offered to the customer. Cyberlab’s product is an exergame that can be used as a tool for exercising and rehabilitation for elderly. The focus of the exergame will be to improve strength and balance in elderly to prevent falls and injuries. By using the exergame, this can be done in a more amusing and motivating way. The game will have one general workout version for training and one customized version for rehabilitation. The exergame will be developed for the Microsoft Kinect sensor for Windows, which tracks body movement without the use of any controllers. This makes it convenient to use for elderly, as it allows them to only focus on the tasks provided by the game. Our proposal is that the exergame can be used in physiotherapy clinics, where physiotherapists can set up customized programs and guide their patients through the exercise. The game is not meant to replace ordinary physiotherapy, but will serve as a supplement. The Microsoft Kinect sensor provides useful feedback to the physiotherapists when it comes to measuring the execution of the exercises and their patients' progression. 
\subsection{Value Proposition}
The exergame's value proposition can be described as: \\ \\
\emph{A tool with the ability to customize an exercise program, and to offer an alternative, fun and motivating training method, while at the same time ease the workload of the physiotherapist.}\\ \\
Value propositions refer to the value a company offers to a specific customer segment. The product offered to the physiotherapists is something completely new. It provides them the possibility to offer an alternative, fun and motivating training and rehabilitation method. The exergame can be used as a supplement in training programs or as an exercise motivator. Social aspects around the game will be provided, because this is seen as highly important aspects for elderly \cite{exergamesforelderly}. This includes offering different games for different interests. The game can also be used as a tool for physiotherapists to make it easier to customize training programs for their patients, which will ease their work. Every patient is different, with individual problems and needs, and it is therefore necessary to provide personalized exercise program for each patient. An important value the product has to serve, is that the exergame can set up training programs and be more motivating than a physiotherapist can. The game should be self-explanatory and easy to use for the end-user. It will also provide useful feedback to inform and encourage the participant.
\section{Customer Interface}
This section will describe the customer segment in more detail, in addition to how Cyberlab can create value for them. In particular we will discuss who the customers are, how to reach out to them and what kind of customer relationships should be maintained after the sale. 
\subsection{Customer Segments}
In general, a company generates value for one specific customer segment or several different customer segments. We believe at this point this game is best suited as a tool for physiotherapists to use when working with elderly. However, we also considered some other possible customer segments: \emph{elderly}, \emph{training groups} and \emph{community centers}. We will briefly discuss why these were not included as additional customer segments in Chapter 9.\\ \\ 
Physiotherapists is the first entity elderly meet with when facing a physical problem. One of their jobs is to help their patients decrease the risk of falling by using mobility techniques to improve balance and physical strength. Physiotherapists are also a group with a certain authority appearance, which makes them trustworthy. Physiotherapists can buy this product, install it in their environment and use it as a tool for training and rehabilitation, both in an individual therapy session and in a training group. \\ \\
We recommend Cyberlab to focus on physiotherapy clinics as customers. More precisely, we will recommend starting with public clinics and private clinics with contribution from the government. The goal of their work fits well with the purpose of Cyberlab's exergame, and the authority they have is very valuable when trying to get elderly to adapt the new technology this game provides. We will discuss in Chapter 9 why we excluded private clinics. The recommended physiotherapy clinics have access to a wide customer base consisting of elderly. It is also important to emphasis the importance of the new reform "Samhandlingsreformen", which encourage the use of welfare technology where possible, discussed in Chapter 3.1 and 3.2. This suggests that there is a place for an exergame in the health sector.  The economy in this entity is controlled by the government. With the support from the new reform, we believe there should be no economic issues around investing in a game like this. 

\subsection{Channels}
In this subsection we will describes how Cyberlab should deliver and market their value propositions to their customer segment. We will describe this by going through the five channel phases, see Figure \ref{fig:Channels}.\\ \\

\caption[The 5 Channel Phases for the Cyberlab]{The 5 Channel Phases [modified from \cite{osterwalder}\cite{osterwalderthesis}]}
\label{fig:Channels}
\end{sidewaysfigure}

\emph{Awareness:} \\ 
We will look into some activities Cyberlab should perform to raise awareness about their product and how they can get their customers attention. "Fysioterapeuten" is a magazine targeting physiotherapists in Norway. This magazine is published by \ac{nff} and distributed to the whole country. "Fysioterapeuten" contains mostly scientific papers, and the idea is that this magazine shall contribute to evolvement of the physiotherapy profession. This magazine is read by 9 000 physiotherapists around the country, and articles printed here are perceived as scientific and are therefore taken seriously \cite{fysioomoss}. Cyberlab should use "Fysioterapeuten" as a medium to promote the exergame by printing articles or ads. Printing research papers and articles about the exergame in other credible magazines or newspapers is also a way to get physiotherapists attention. \\ \\
Another solution for Cyberlab is to promote their product by taking direct contact with the customer segment. This could be done by taking part in conferences related to subjects like e.g. welfare technology, or by visiting physiotherapy clinics. Cyberlab will then get the opportunity to present the product and show direct interest in establishing a customer relationship. An example of a highly relevant conference for Cyberlab to attend is "Velferdsteknologikonferansen" \cite{conference}. This is a conference that has been held in Trondheim three times, and is describes as a conference for people that are interested in welfare technology and "Samhandlingsreformen". Physiotherapists see it as very relevant to try a product for an amount of time before they decide to buy. Cyberlab can raise awareness around the product by announcing that they need participants for a pilot project. Awareness can also arise from an already ongoing pilot project. \\ \\
\emph{Evaluation:}\\
Physiotherapists we have talked to pointed out two very important aspects in evaluating a product. These two are; documented effect of the product and own experience by testing the product. If a physiotherapist should even think about trying the product, it is necessary to provide research papers and statistics that show positive effect on the use of this kind of game. Documentation will give them a security in the choice of buying the product. Other physiotherapists providing positive feedback after trying the game also contributes to this security. We suggest that Cyberlab should start pilot projects at one or more physiotherapy clinics, as this is a good way to be evaluated. A pilot project will provide the physiotherapists with the possibility to test, experience and evaluate the product themselves for a period of time. The experiences from the pilot projects should be used as documentation for the product.\\ \\
\emph{Purchase:} \\
Most physiotherapists have already established connections with suppliers. Ordering and buying products are usually done online, but it can also be done by phone or when interesting products are discovered on conferences. Going to the store to buy products is very unusual. To play this game there are software and hardware needed, like Microsoft Kinect sensor and the exergame. It is unreasonable to think that a physiotherapy clinic already owns a Kinect sensor, so the best strategy for Cyberlab is to sell packages containing both hardware and software. Packages should include various agreements with appropriate pricing. Cyberlab should sell the game through their own channels. We suggest that the ordering of this game should be done on Cyberlab's web page. This is convenient for Cyberlab, who does not need to pick up the phone every time someone wants to order the product. It is also convenient for the customer, because ordering online is not a very time-consuming matter, and most people are familiar with online purchase. \\ \\
\emph{Delivery:}\\
Feedback from the interviews shows the huge importance of start-up help. They expressed a desire for installation and introduction help for technical products. With busy days at work, physiotherapists do not have time to pick up deliveries at the postal office, or to setup and learn new products all by themselves. Buying, receiving, installing and learning should not be difficult or time-consuming. \\ \\
The product should be delivered at the door, by someone who can install the product and teach the physiotherapists how to use it. However, this is a complicated task for Cyberlab if we look at every physiotherapy clinic in Norway as their customer segment. It will be very inconvenient and costly if one representative from Cyberlab will travel around in Norway based on where they get the order from. However, Cyberlab should offer these services to those customers who are willing to pay for it.  \\ \\
\emph{After sales:}\\
When taking a new product into use, it is important for the physiotherapists to have the possibility to come with feedback. Therefore, Cyberlab should have some kind of support that can take these feedback into consideration. Feedback can be comments on direct errors or directions on how to make the exergame more suitable for its use. Cyberlab should follow their customer in the process of learning, and they should inform them of new features and improvements. We suggest that Cyberlab should accept feedback on e-mail and that they provide the buyers with a phone number for critical support.  
\subsection{Customer Relationships}
Customer relationship is an important part of the customer experience, and it describes what kind of relationship the company establishes with the customers. Support, follow-up and feedback handling are some aspects in establishing customer relationship. Cyberlab should establish a personal relationship with their customers, and be available when the customers have problems and need help. When using a new product one may discover errors or find the product not suitable for its use, so many physiotherapists have an eager to provide feedback on this. Cyberlab should handle these feedback and fix errors as soon as possible and take comments on improvements into consideration. Using feedback to make a better product shows customers that Cyberlab takes their comments seriously.  In addition, the customers will hopefully get a more suitable product.  If Cyberlab maintains a direct and personal contact with the customers, it will show the customers that they care about the use and experience of the game.  All this can contribute to a good customer relationship. Cyberlab should also give their customers a heads ups on updates, new features or products. As mentioned under \emph{after sales} in Section 8.2.2, this communication should be carried out over e-mail. We mean that this will make the relationship personal, but not inappropriate (e.g. annoying customers with telephone calls). We suggest that Cyberlab should provide their customers with updates and new features of the game (e.g. a new theme), which will make the customers use the product for a longer period of time. They will then become more familiar with the product, and engage a relation to Cyberlab. This is a way to lock the customers to them as a provider. If exergaming becomes popular and common, more providers can appear. Then it will be important for Cyberlab to retain their customers. 

\section{Infrastructure Management}
This section is about how Cyberlab creates value. What resources needed and what activities that have to be performed are described here, as well as if they will get them in-house or from a partner. 

\subsection{Key Resources}

In this section we will describe all the resources needed to make the business model work. The resources are divided into four different types, described in Table \ref{tab:Resources}.
\newpage

\begin{table}
\centering
    \begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
        \hline
       \textbf{Type of Resource} & \textbf{Resource}  \\ \hline

        \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption[Resources]{Different types of resources}
    \label{tab:Resources}
\end{table} 
\emph{Intellectual} \\ The developer team needs insight and knowledge about different exercises that will strengthen muscles and improve balance in elderly. Cyberlab is provided with research information from other entities in this project, so their job will be to process this information. When they have enough knowledge to form the foundation of an exercise program, they can start to get creative. Creativity is needed to make the game entertaining and easy to understand and conduct. In addition, good programming competencies are needed to develop the game. To make it as cost-efficient as possible, an experienced team should be put together. \\ \\
\emph{Physical} \\ To be able to conduct this project, the team needs premises and everything that comes with it, like desks, chairs, computers, internet connection, lights etc. Cyberlab is an already established business, so we can assume they already have these premises and equipment established, and that this will not provide any additional costs. For this project, they will need specific hardware. The hardware consists of the Kinect sensor, a Windows machine, a server for storing and running the game and a projector and screen for testing purposes. In addition they will need the Kinect for Windows SDK to be able to develop a game for this platform. Last they will need to expand their web page with sites for information about the game, news and ordering/purchasing. \\ \\
\emph{Human} \\ Programming skills and creativity are already described above as intellectual resources. This means they will need system developers and interaction designers. An administration is needed for marketing, customer related tasks and resource management. When the game is finished it needs to be operated and maintained. These tasks can be done by one or more of the system developers. They will also need people to follow the pilot project. We believe this can be done by one of the project team members. \\ \\
\emph{Finance} \\ This project is financed by the European Union. However, we will not take this into account when looking at the financial aspects of the game. There are two main reasons for this. First, as explained in the introduction, Cyberlab is part of a project called "GameUp". There are several entities involved in this project. Without any more knowledge about the project and the different entities' roles it is hard for us to know how the costs and revenues will be divided between them. Second, there was a desire from Cyberlab to look at how they can make it on their own in the Norwegian market. 

\subsection{Key Activities}
Cyberlab's work can be described as a Value Chain, which means transforming inputs into a final product. From the knowledge and experience Cyberlab has acquired they want to make the game as good, cost efficient and price-competitive so that their customers would choose their product instead of a product with similar value. A description of the different stages in the value chain is depicted in Figure \ref{fig:ValueChainCase}. The development of the game should be test-driven, meaning that they will test the product both on the end-users and the customer segment during the development, and adapt the game based on the experiences acquired during the testing. Activities that need to be done include research processing, development, testing, maintenance and updates, support, marketing and administrative tasks, shown in Table \ref{tab:activities}. \\ \\
Cyberlab is provided with research information from Norut, a national research group from Tromsø. Cyberlab's first task will be to process this information to understand the requirements for the game. Cyberlab will also be provided with suitable exercises that professionals know is good for the end-user. Cyberlab has to find a way to build the game around these exercises. An important task is to make the game user-friendly and easy to use. Prototypes should be made and tested on the end-user to see if the game is easy to understand and conduct. This includes menu choices, information feedback and the execution of the game. The physiotherapists should also take part in this. After the game has been tested, they have to modify the game according to the feedback, and test it again. This should be done until every actor is satisfied. During the development, they should get one or more clinics to participate in a pilot project. This should start as soon as the game is finished, but they can also be involved in the testing during the development phase. The documentation from this pilot project is important when marketing the product. The marketing task is very important, and should be put much thought into. Marketing should happen through the channels described in Chapter 8.2.2.  We will discuss marketing in more detail in Chapter 8.4.1. An additional important part of the development is to find out how to set up the infrastructure (e.g. databases, servers, communication between entities). After the game is finished and delivered to the customers, it has to be maintained and enhanced. New versions and updates should be provided for keeping a customer relationship. In addition, they must provide support to the customers.

\subsection{Key Partnerships}

Norut is a national research group located in Tromsø. Cyberlab depends on them because they provide them with research information. This is the only entity Cyberlab depends solely on, so this is the only key partner. \\ \\ 

\section{Financial Aspects}
In this section all the outgoing and incoming cash flows will be described. All the previous blocks are contributing to a cost or an income. We will try to provide a realistic and detailed estimate of both cost and income, and then make an analysis of potential profit. It is important to mention that we have done many assumptions and that not all costs are taken into consideration. We will describe this as the assumptions are made.

\subsection{Cost Structure}
Cost structure takes into account all elements that generates costs specific to this game. Cyberlab is an already established business and we can therefore assume that there are not any additional costs associated with premises and some of the "regular" equipment (e.g. desks, chairs, computers etc.). We will not distinguish between fixed and variable costs, but rather look at every cost as fixed, annual costs. Variable costs are salaries associated with support and administrative tasks. Here we will assume that these tasks have assigned a fixed amount of workload for each year. Further, we will distinguish between investment costs and ongoing costs. Cyberlab's costs have the characteristic \emph{economies of scale}, meaning that the cost per unit will fall when output rise. This is due to a marginal cost close to 0.  The cost structure of this business will be both value-driven and cost-driven. They will make a cost-efficient product, that will serve all its value propositions. The value of this game is important to distinguish it from "ordinary" video games. \\ \\
\textbf{Investment Costs}\\
Investment costs are all the costs associated with the development of the game. This includes salaries for the development team, the hardware and software needed to develop the game and the cost of the pilot project. We will assume that the development of the game will take 6 months, and that they will carry out a pilot project for 6 months. This means that Cyberlab is looking at a whole year without revenue.\\ \\
\emph{Hardware and Software:}\\
The commercial price for the Kinect sensor is 1 790 NOK \cite{pricekinect}, and the \ac{sdk} for the sensor is free. In addition they should have a screen for testing purposes. The screen should be of significant size, so we suggest they invest in a projector and a 90" projector screen, which should be sufficient for its purpose. We found that the cost of an average screen is 895 NOK and 2 449 NOK for a projector \cite{priceprojector}\cite{pricescreen}.\\ \\
\emph{Development:}\\
Cyberlab has estimated that for the development of this game they need a \ac{fte} = 1.0, meaning that the workload is equivalent to one person working full time for a year. We assume that this will cover development, testing and administrative tasks during the development. In addition, Norut who provides research has also assigned a \ac{fte} = 1.0. How many people assigned to the project is unknown and also irrelevant for the cost prediction (assuming every employee has the same salary). We have done an estimate of how much the cost of having an engineer with a \ac{fte} = 1.0 in the private sector is. From \cite{tekna} we found statistics of salary in the private sector in Norway. Assuming that the "average" employer on this project graduated in the end of the 90's, we look at an average gross salary of approximately 730 000 NOK a year. From this we can calculate the average cost of a \ac{fte} = 1.0, based on \cite{altinn}, which will be 1 003 349, see Table \ref{tab:costofFTE} for calculations. We did the same calculations for researchers in the government controlled sector and for marketers in the private sector. They both ended up on a cost of 715 577. See Appendix E for calculations.\\ \\

    \caption[Cost of FTE = 1.0]{The cost of FTE = 1.0 in the private sector (for Cyberlab)}

	    \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \label{tab:costofFTE}
\end{table}
\emph{Pilot Project:}\\
As mentioned we suggest that Cyberlab should run a pilot project to document the effect of the game. This will also serve as a very effective way of marketing the game. We suggest that the pilot project should be carried out in one or more clinics in Trondheim for convenience, and that it should run for six months. The effect has to be documented both during and after the project. This documentation should be published in scientific articles and distributed to physiotherapists. The pilot project will most likely provide Cyberlab with valuable feedback on the game, where they can both test the usability in a real environment as well as discover bugs. This will require close monitoring from Cyberlab, so we suggest that this will require a \ac{fte} = 1/5 for  six months (this equals \ac{fte} = 1/10 seen in a whole year). In addition they will have to pay the physiotherapists working with the pilot project. We assume this will be the same amount as their hourly salary. For these six months we will recommend the amount physiotherapists are working with this equal to a FTE=2/5 (or FTE=1/5 seen in a whole year).\\ \\
The investment costs are summarized in Table \ref{tab:investmentcosts}.\\ \\

    \end{tabular}
    \label{tab:investmentcosts}
\end{table}
\newpage
\textbf{Ongoing Costs}\\
We will now look at the ongoing costs on a per year basis. With the rapid evolution of technology, we believe that Cyberlab can offer this game for five years after its release. After these years, they will probably have to start making new versions, even for new types of technology. We do not take the development of new versions into account in our calculation, and we will set the lifetime of this game to be five years. Table \ref{tab:ongoing} summarises the annual costs. \\ \\
\emph{Storage:}\\
The game has to be operated on a server. This can be on a server located in Cyberlab’s office, a server located at one of the physiotherapy clinics or on a cloud hosted server. The size of a Kinect game will vary, depending on quality, colors, how many levels etc. At this stage it is hard to make an exact assumption on how big the game will become. There will be a need for a database with user data and log-data, as well as some web content for portal interface (configuration for the games etc.). The dynamic part of the space needed on the server is associated with how much log-data it needs to store. However, this will not be very space consuming. Based on this, we believe that Cyberlab can make it with a small server of fixed size. From Gogrid Servers \cite{priceserver} we found a small server with storage space of 25 GB. We believe this will be sufficient for Cyberlab's purpose. There is also reasonable to believe that Cyberlab has some space available on their servers. However, if they would have to rent this kind of server space, we are looking at an annual price of \$181.25 which is roughly 1 087 NOK (with a currency of \$1 = 6 NOK).\\ \\
\emph{Support and Maintenance:}\\
With new software and technology there will always appear some errors after the product or service is delivered. We can assume that the first six months are the most critical months, and will require a \ac{fte} = 1/5. The remaining lifetime will only need support for some minor problems that might appear (e.g. customer service). We assume this period will require a \ac{fte} = 1/10 (each year). This is roughly predicted numbers, because this may vary over time. However, our predicted numbers are reasonable as "average" numbers, taking unexpected events into account.  \\ \\
\emph{Marketing:}\\
Marketing is one of the most important parts of selling a product or service. This is especially important in the first year of the game's lifetime. The cost of marketing is difficult to analyse because it depends on how long it will take to acquire customers. New products or services need to acquire customers quickly, and therefore more resources need to be put into the marketing tasks. We can look at the exergame as a niche product that is targeting a specific customer segment. The marketing task needs to be customized for this specific customer segment. When a critical mass (the number of customers needed to survive economically in the market) is reached, the market will somehow be self-supported \cite{informationrules}. We believe that after this critical phase, the marketing costs will be rather low and close to constant. We assume that the first year right before, during and after the release, the marketing task will contribute to a \ac{fte} = 1/2. After being on the market for one year, the customer base should have reached critical mass.  We believe that in this type of community (the physiotherapy community), words spread fast. If someone starts using a product that is proven good, it will soon appear in magazines and by word of mouth, resulting in the interest from others. Even after critical mass is reached, there will be some marketing related tasks (e.g. keep up with the market, look for new customer segments), so we suggest that the marketing tasks should contribute to a \ac{fte} = 1/5 after the first year. With this low workload, Cyberlab could consider to hire a marketing consultant instead of having a permanent employee. However, in this analysis, we assume they have employed a marketing person for this task. Other costs related to marketing are the costs of promoting the product on different arenas (e.g. ad in a magazine). For simplicity, we will assume these costs are contained in the cost of having employed a marketing person. \\ \\
\emph{Costs associated to sales:}\\
The exergame will be sold to the customer as a package with the Kinect sensor and the game included. For convenience, a more comprehensive package with everything else needed to play the game (e.g. screen and a Windows machine), should be offered to the interested buyer. Here Cyberlab could gain some profit. However, for simplicity we will assume that the package includes the Kinect sensor and the game only, and that Cyberlab will not gain any profit on the Kinect sensor sold. We will also assume that Cyberlab buys the sensors on demand, meaning they do not have the sensors in stock. This is because the risk of having a stock, discussed in Chapter 9. In addition, Cyberlab has to pay tax. This is not taken into account here. With our simplifications and assumptions there are no costs associated to the specific sales. \\ \\

\subsection{Revenue Streams}
Revenue streams describe how a company can earn money. There can exist one or several revenue streams with different pricing mechanism. Cyberlab will generate revenue by selling their product as a package, containing software, hardware, and services, to physiotherapy clinics. There are various ways to sell this product package, and we will present two possible ways to generate revenue; a fixed price model and a usage fee model. \\ \\ 
We recommend Cyberlab to sell their exergame as a part of a package, consisting of both software and hardware. Hardware needed to play this exergame is the Kinect sensor, a Windows computer and a screen. What physiotherapy clinics need and already have of technology varies. Some clinics might already possess a television; other might request a screen and a projector. Cyberlab should therefore offer the possibility to customize packages in accordance to their customers' needs. The hardware that has to be included in all the packages is the Kinect sensor; as this is what we least expect a physiotherapy clinic to already own. Another feature to be included in the package is delivery, installation assistance and introduction help, which we have experienced as an important offer for physiotherapists. It is useful to give an introduction for this type of technology equipment. Physiotherapist might not have time to learn how the products work, which often results in buying a product they never use due to lack of information. A package containing an offer like this would have a higher price as it covers wages and expenses related to travel. However, all of the interviewees mentioned delivery, installation and introduction as important, so we believe this is a potential revenue stream for Cyberlab. \\ \\ 
We will now present our two chosen revenue models. The recommended prices in the two models will only cover the software and the Kinect sensor expenses. Additional hardware and services requested are for simplicity not taken in to consideration as it most likely will vary from customer to customer. 25 percent \ac{vat} will be added on top of the package price, but this will not be shown in our calculations. In section 8.4.3 we will show how we arrived on the prices suggested below.\\ \\
\emph{Proposal 1 - Fixed Price Model}\\  
A fixed price model implies selling a product to a fixed price. Cyberlab will sell their exergame as a part of a package consisting of both software and hardware. The price for a package should be 12 000 NOK. The total package price for the physiotherapy clinics will depend on additional hardware and services needed. \\ \\
\emph{Proposal 2 - Usage Fee Model}\\
With a usage fee model the customers will pay a low start price for the package and a certain amount of money for each time they use the product. A suitable start price for a package with this model is 2 000 NOK, and an additional 50 NOK for each hour the game is used. The low start price will not alone cover all of Cyberlab's total costs, even if they sell to all their potential customers, so they depend on customers using the product. This model will have the same possibility to include additional hardware and services as the fixed price model. \\ \\
The two revenue models and their price proposals will be discussed and analysed in more detail in the next section.

\subsection{Financial Analysis}
In this section we will make a financial analysis based on the costs and the different revenue models just described. We will give a recommendation on prices suitable for the different models in order for Cyberlab to generate profit, while still remaining competitive in the market. \\ \\
\textbf{The Potential Market} \\ \\
Before pricing the product it is necessary to observe today's market. To understand the market, we have to look at prices on existing games and physiotherapy tools, and try to find a place in between where the game fits. We also have to predict a potential demand for this product. Demand will depend on the documentation of the product and popularity within the physiotherapy community, as well as the product price. Calculating an exact demand for this product is impossible due to the lack of existing games in the same genre and information about the market. It is also hard because the game Cyberlab is going to sell does not exist yet, which makes it difficult for the customers to show their interest. Cyberlab’s market potential can be roughly calculated by looking at the number of public clinics and private physiotherapy clinics with support from the government, from now on referred to as physiotherapy clinics or just clinics. We looked at four municipalities in Norway; Oslo, Trondheim, Fredrikstad and T{ø}nsberg, where we for each found the number of clinics and compared that number to the population in each municipality. The average ratio we got, describes inhabitants per clinic in Norway. Finding the total population in Norway and dividing this by the average ratio, gave us an approximation of physiotherapy clinics suitable for Cyberlab's customer segment. Our calculation shows that Cyberlab has a potential market of approximately 1 200 physiotherapy clinics in Norway. Calculations are shown in Appendix G. We contacted \ac{nff} to ask about the actual number of clinics in Norway, but they could not provide us with an exact number. Because of this we made our own calculation.\\ \\
We suggest that Cyberlab should start with Trondheim as their main focus. The reason for this is that the product has been developed in Trondheim and that they already have established relationships with some entities through the EU-funded project. This will make it convenient for Cyberlab to follow up and to respond quickly to requested changes or possible errors, as well as monitoring the progression. We will now assume that the game has been developed, is well-documented, has received a great amount of positive feedback and has been accepted by the physiotherapy community. With these conditions in place we believe that there will be a diffusion of the game, starting slowly in Trondheim and as it gets more and more attention it will spread to the rest of the country. This means that it might take some time before Cyberlab will generate any profit, as we will demonstrate later in this section. We can describe the diffusion of a product with an S-curve, depicted in Figure \ref{fig:scurve}. \\ \\
The S-curve describes how an innovation will adopt customers over time. In the introduction of a product or service it will take some time to adopt a critical mass. There are different types of people adapting to the technology at different time. These types can be defined as innovators, early adopters, early majority, late majority, and laggards. As the actors are adapting to the technology, the market share will grow and eventually reach its saturation level, meaning it has reached to all potential adopters. Most innovations can be described with an S-curve, but the curve will look different for different innovations\cite{scurve}.\\ \\
With the S-curve in mind, we will try to put a number on what we believe Cyberlab can expect to sell in each of the five years after the game’s release. Even though the potential market consist of 1 200 clinics, we do not think it is reasonable to reach out to all of them. A maybe more realistic sales number would be to cover one-third of the potential market share, which is 400 clinics. The reason for this is that it is a great amount of uncertainty related to the exergame. The video game itself is not a new technology, but the use of video games as an equipment in physiotherapy treatment is. The market is immature and inexperienced, so the exergame could meet a great amount of doubt when launched. We have to take into consideration that there are physiotherapy clinics that do not see the need for an exergame. In one of the interviews we were also told that physiotherapists could be a conservative group of people. It could be difficult to convince them into trying something new and different from what they are already used to. It should be mentioned that the market potential can become bigger if they decide to include other customers segments. This will be discussed in Chapter 9. As already explained the six months before the release will consist of the pilot project only. We assume that this will be carried out in two different clinics. This will not generate any revenue. Now we will assume that the pilot project has been successful and that the product is well-documented. In all the municipals there are close collaboration between the different entities in the health sector. Therefore we can assume that other physiotherapy clinics in Trondheim also will adapt to the game. In addition, the game will be adopted by the innovators that are eager to try new things. Let us say this will count for 48 sales, or 12 percent of the potential market share of 400 clinics. As clinics are starting to use the game and the word spreads about an useful and effective tool, more people will adopt. Roughly estimated, we believe the game will reach its potential market share in its fourth year. Then even some of the laggards who were sceptical to the product at first, start using it. We believe that most of the customers will adopt the game during the third year, because then it has had sufficient time to mature, see Figure \ref{fig:scurve2}. \\ \\

\newpage
\textbf{Pricing}\\ \\
The product price depends on existing games and tools, and Cyberlab's costs. Estimating a suitable product price will be done by financial analysis and by looking at related, existing products on the market. Cyberlab's exergame falls under two definitions, a video game and a tool used in physiotherapy for training and rehabilitation. The video game market today exists of a huge amount of various games. They are mostly in an affordable price range, where e.g. Nintendo Wii games are priced between 99 - 499 NOK \cite{elkjopwii} and Xbox Kinect games are priced between 199 - 399 NOK \cite{elkjopkinect}. In addition there will be a cost of buying the needed hardware. Physiotherapy tools have more variation in price range as the definition of this tools are quite wide. Prices can vary from a fixed price of 120 NOK for a stretch pulley \cite{stretchpulley}, 11 000 NOK per month for shockwave therapy leasing (see Appendix C), up to 75 000 NOK for a treadmill \cite{treadmill}. Trying to sell the exergame for more than the existing video games on the market can be difficult. Therefore it is important for Cyberlab to promote their product as more than just a regular game to justify the price difference. This should be done by emphasizing the products value propositions, which relates the product more to physiotherapy equipment than "just" a video game. \\ \\
We will now present a detailed analysis of the two revenue models proposed in Chapter 8.4.2, and provide different price recommendations for the product. It is important to distinguish between Cyberlab's revenue and the package price presented for the customers. The product package shall as mentioned include the exergame and the Kinect sensor, but it is not the intention that Cyberlab shall make profit from reselling the Kinect sensors. The price a customer pays when buying a product package will balance Cyberlab's expense from purchasing a Kinect sensor, which makes it possible to neglect this cash flow from the analysis. Therefore, only the software price will be taken into consideration in our analysis. A suitable price for the software should cover all expenses related to the game. While Cyberlab's total cost is 3 238 775 NOK, we have for simplicity,  rounded the cost up to 3 240 000 NOK in our calculations. The Kinect sensor price is for the same reason rounded up to 2 000 NOK. \\ \\ 
\emph{Proposal 1 - Fixed Price Model}\\ \\
As the exergame in some way can be compared with video games, a reasonable price would be a price similar to other video games on the market. The price range of existing Xbox Kinect games are 199 – 399, so we choose to price the game at 300 NOK. How Cyberlab’s revenue will emerge with this price is shown in Figure \ref{fig:FixedLowPrice}. We observe that Cyberlab has to sell about 10 800 units to cover their total cost, which is an amount almost ten times higher than the potential market share of 1 200 physiotherapy clinics. We can therefore conclude that it will be impossible for Cyberlab to sell their game for a price as low as 300 NOK without experiencing huge economic loss.\\ \\
\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.8]{revenuestreamprice}
\caption[Price example]{The lowest possible package price Cyberlab can take, provided that they sell the max amount of 1 200 packages. This is 2 700 NOK per package}
\label{fig:RevenueStreamPrice}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
If we assume that Cyberlab has the possibility to sell their product to all of the 1 200 physiotherapy clinics in Norway, they could have a price as low as 2 700 NOK, see Figure \ref{fig:RevenueStreamPrice}, without gaining negative profit. However, it is very risky, and almost unreasonable, to assume that Cyberlab could reach out to all potential target customers. \\ \\
Figure \ref{fig:RevenueStreamQuantity} shows three income lines related to three different prices, and how much Cyberlab, with each price, has to sell to cover their costs. With a price of 6 000 NOK Cyberlab needs to sell at least 540 units to achieve non-negative profit, but with a price of 10 000 NOK they only have to sell 324 units, see Table \ref{tab:unitsfixed}. Selling to the expected market share, Cyberlab can price 405 units at 8 000 NOK, which will balance Cyberlab's profit. Figure \ref{fig:RelationPriceAndUnits} shows every combination of price and quantity that will make a revenue of 3 240 000 NOK, which covers all of Cyberlab's costs. However, we believe that Cyberlab is interested in earning more than 0 NOK, so we recommend to sell the software for 10 000 NOK. This price will be seen by the customer as 12 000 NOK, because of the additional cost of the Kinect sensor. We see that a fixed price package like this has a much higher price than existing video games on the market; however, it still is in the affordable range compared to other physiotherapy equipment. \\ \\
The sale of the product package will follow an earlier described S-curve, where we have distributed a potential sale of 400 games over a five year period. Table \ref{tab:revfixed} shows the expected revenue when selling 400 product packages. We observe that Cyberlab will gain a profit of 1 099 097 NOK by selling the software at a fixed price of 10 000 NOK. Figure \ref{fig:ProfitFixed} shows the relationship between the accumulated revenue, cost and profit over a five year period. From this figure we can see that Cyberlab will start to gain profit after about two and a half year. \\ \\

\newpage
\emph{Proposal 2 - Usage Fee Model}\\ \\
We will start by making an estimate of how much the exergame potentially will be used at physiotherapy clinics. Usually, a physiotherapist works approximately 8 hours each day, which includes 30 minutes lunch-break. Not every patient visiting the physiotherapy clinic during a regular day falls under the category "elderly", and not every elderly visiting the clinic has the need for or wants to use this exergame. We roughly estimate that the exergame will be used approximately 2 hours each day. A physiotherapist works 47 weeks a year, assuming they have 5 weeks of vacation. This add up to 470 hours a year where the exergame will be used.\\ \\
Our first package price proposal in this usage fee model is a start price of 2 000 NOK for the package and a price of 10 NOK for each hour physiotherapists use the exergame. During a year this will add up to 4 700 NOK if the game is used as much as estimated. Here the Kinect sensor is included in the package price. Therefore, since Cyberlab’s revenue should be calculated without consideration of the Kinect sensor, we subtract the Kinect sensor expense from the expected income. Each customer choosing the usage fee model will give Cyberlab an estimated revenue stream of approximately 2 700 NOK. For Cyberlab to be able to cover all costs they have to sell 1 200 packages. This means that they have to sell to all of the potential customers, which we already have evaluated to be unrealistic. We therefore provide another price proposal. We use the same startup price, but choose a price of 50 NOK for each hour the exergame is used. This will add up to 25 500 NOK, and without the Kinect sensor expenses Cyberlab will gain a revenue of approximately 23 500 NOK. In this case, Cyberlab only needs to sell 138 units to make a profit, a significant difference from the previous price example. See Appendix H for calculations. \\ \\

\end{center}
\end{figure}
\newpage
As with the fixed price model we assume that Cyberlab is able to reach the realistic market share of 400 physiotherapy clinics. Table \ref{tab:revusage} shows Cyberlab's revenue when selling 400 units over a five year period. We assume that the exergame is used as much as estimated. To be able to calculate a revenue stream created by a sold package, we have looked at the start price and usage fees throughout one year as one total income. See Appendix H for details. We observe that the income increases significantly in this usage fee example compared to the fixed price example. Where we in the fixed price example showed that Cyberlab achieved a profit of 1 099 097 NOK, they can with this usage fee model sell the same amount of units and achieve an almost five time greater profit of 5 257 399 NOK. Figure \ref{fig:ProfitUsageFee} shows the relationship between the accumulated revenue, cost and profit over a five year period. We observe that Cyberlab will gain profit after about one and a half year, one year earlier than with the fixed price model. \\ \\
Another solution for the usage fee model is for Cyberlab to give away their product package for free and just rely on the customers using the product. Figure \ref{fig:UsageWithWithout} compares the revenue streams when having an initial start price and when the product package is given away for free. We can see that there is not that much of a difference between these two examples. If Cyberlab gives their product package away for free, the usage fee still is 50 NOK, and customers use the exergame as much as we have estimated, they need to give away 151 packages to gain profit. \\ \\
\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.8]{usagewithwithoutstartprice}
\caption[Usage fee example]{Revenue with and without start price for the product package with a usage fee model. We assume that the exergame is used as much as estimated}
\label{fig:UsageWithWithout}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
We can conclude that the best solution for Cyberlab will be to use the usage fee model. There is a high risk related to profit, but the profit has the potential of becoming significantly higher than with a fixed price model. As mentioned, the low startup price for the usage fee model is not alone enough to cover all of Cyberlabs costs, so even if Cyberlab manage to cover the estimated market of 400 clinics, they will experience an economic loss if no one use the product. If the product never gets used, Cyberlab will not gain any revenue at all, which will make a negative profit equal to the estimated total cost. This is because the income of 2 000 NOK per package will be used to cover the Kinect sensor expenses. The loss will become even bigger if Cyberlab chooses the usage fee model that includes giving the product package away. However, in both cases, if all of the 400 customers use the exergame only one hour each day for one year, it will be enough for Cyberlab to gain profit. Also, if there is only one exergame at a physiotherapy clinic, the game would be shared among several physiotherapists, and we can expect the exergame to be used more. Expected lifetime for the exergame is approximately five years, so Cyberlab is actually only dependent on customers using the game one hour per week, which is very likely. \\ \\   
Choosing the model with startup price of 2 000 NOK instead of the give-away solution, gives Cyberlab a difference in profit of approximately 723 000 NOK when selling 400 units. From the customer's point of view there will be very attractive to get this product package for free. A possible drawback with the give-away solution is that customers do not have the same incentive to use a product they get for free as they have with a product they have paid for. With a free product package they have nothing to loose by not using it. Because of this, and the risk already related to the usage fee model, we recommend Cyberlab to choose the startup price solution. \\ \\ 
For the customers point of view a usage fee model will appear more appealing than a fixed package price because of the low startup price. Customers observe that the product price is higher than other existing video games on the market, but they also know what value propositions this exergame holds, which justify the price difference. They also have information about prices on equipment used at physiotherapy clinics, which makes Cyberlab’s usage fee model affordable. Customers also have other reasons for why they prefer this solution. One example is that a physiotherapy clinic might see a security in buying the product with a usage fee model. The startup price is manageable, and they can control additional costs themselves according to how much they want to use the game. \\ \\
Figure \ref{fig:RevenueAll} presents six revenue stream examples from both the fixed price model and the usage fee model. We have included three different fixed prices, two different usage fees, and usage fee with and without start price. We still assume that Cyberlab is able to sell 400 units, and that the game, with the usage fee model, is used as much as estimated. The revenue streams are presented on a per year basis, during a lifetime of five years. Number of units sold per year is distributed by the S-curve, described earlier in this section. We clearly see that the solution with a usage fee model, with a start price and a fee of 50 NOK, gives the highest revenue. By using this model, Cyberlab can expect to experience high profit. See Appendix F for calculations.

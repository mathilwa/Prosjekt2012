\section{Security aspects}
There are some issues regarding the security of personal information associated to this game. When a clinic starts using this game, they will make a user profile for each patient. This profile will presumably contain name, age, physical and mental conditions, diagnosis, the patients exercise program and the history of games played. It might also contain other type of information, like home address, phone number, relatives etc. The purpose of this record is for the physiotherapist to easily keep track of the patients improvement and to be able to adjust a program in an efficient way. \\ \\
The goal in the long run for this game is that patients eventually can start using this game at home as a supplement to their regular treatment. It will then be possible for the physiotherapist treating these patient, to log on to and look at the patient’s profile at any time. This profile will probably be a webpage where the patient (or user) and the physiotherapist treating this patient can log in. This webpage will be retrieved from a remote server hosted by either Cyberlab or in the cloud. \\ \\
Anything on the web always face some security issues, and we could spend a lot of time discussing all the different treats and vulnerabilities. However, this is out of scope of this project, so we will only discuss some aspects to keep in mind for these user profiles.\\ \\
SSL should be used for secure communication between the server and the client. This prevents eavesdropping, tampering and message forgery. (siter securityboka).It is important to know that the right person with permission is getting access to the information. This require proper login and authentication. However, something that we can ask ourselves is how sensitive the information contained on the web page really is? Of course, no one would like anyone to read their health history. Except from that you can really get the other information anywhere else on the web. If an intruder steels someone's login information, they will get full access to the profile and can read and alter all the information.  \\ \\
One way of not linking the actual patient to the information, is to use patient numbers. This requires the physiotherapists to have their own database with patient names linked to patient numbers. We assume they already have this. However, this will make it more inconvenient for the physiotherapists to use, because they will have to look up every patient number and link it to the name themselves. It is very important for the physiotherapists that the information will be given to them in an easy and efficient way, so this solution will not hold. \\ \\
What harm will a possible information leakage do? First, if an attacker get access to the data and reads it, they can get some interesting information. For example they can read a medical description that says that the patient is in a wheelchair. If in addition they can get the address from the patients profile, this house can be a target for a robbery. ...Ikke ferdig.. (Første utkast)

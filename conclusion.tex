\chapter{Conclusion}
There is great uncertainty related to the potential of this game. It is a new technological tool which will face a small and immature market. In addition, the fact that the game is not yet developed made it hard for us to understand the game, as well as describe the game to physiotherapists that we interviewed. However, with support in the Norwegian health sector's new focus and a positive attitude from physiotherapists we have talked to, we believe that the game has a potential on this market. The great amount of research that has been done on video games for health-related purposes the last couple of years, also suggest potential for the exergame. This requires Cyberlab to develop an entertaining and easy-to use game, customized with the right exercises for elderly. If they do this, they can expect to become successful in this market and gain significant profit.  
\section{Future Work}
Future work for Cyberlab will be to find out how their exergame should be made. They know which exercises that are good for the target user, but they have to find a way to integrate them.  This should be done in a way that makes the game entertaining and easy to use, which also can be customized for the usersâ€™ needs and interests. As a part of this, it needs to be done more research on which type of games that are suitable for elderly.  In the making of the exergame, they should suggest to offer the opportunity to multiplay, as this would most likely be much appreciated by both the physiotherapists and the end user. \\ \\
The infrastructure of the game has to be well thought through. They how to find out where data will be stored, and how the data can be transferred from entity to entity. This includes the security aspects of having private information stored on a server.Cyberlab should also take the ethical aspects of storing and processing personal data into account. \\ \\
Last, we will suggest to look into what kind of business potential the game has with other customer segments. This includes customer segments discussed in Chapter 9, but especially other countries in Europe, since this exergame is developed as a part of an EU-funded project. The market potential will increase tremendously if they expanded to the rest of Europe. This requires new business models. \\ \\

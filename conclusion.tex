\chapter{Conclusion}
There are much uncertainty related to the development of this exergame. It is a new technological solution which will face a small market with potential difficult customers. However, we have seen a great interest for the this type of game, and this together with the envolvement of the Norwegian health sector, shows that there are a great potential for use of Cyberlab’s exergame. Even though we have made many assumptions in our financial analysis, they are realistic enough make a conclusion about the economic aspect of this game. With the assumption that 400 physiotherapy clinics buy Cyberlab’s exergame, we conclude that this project shows economic promise.

\begin{abstract}
A major problem in the society today is the decrease in the health in elderly. Reduction of physical strength and balance can result in falls or increased fair of falling. It might not seem like a serious event, but it actually is the main reason for injuries in elderly. Falling can lead to reduced quality of life because of inactivity, loneliness, loss of self-confidence and depression. The worst outcome of falls is death. The problem of falls also results in high cost for the government. Based on this there has been started an EU-funded project that shall use technology to encourage elderly to become more physically active.  One of the participants in this project is Cyberlab, a small company situated in Trondheim. Cyberlab’s part is to develop an exercise game based on video game technology with the use of Microsoft Kinect.  The exercise game, from now on called exergame, shall be used for training and rehabilitation for elderly. Our contribution in this assignment is to discover the business potential for this exergame. We did a brief research of the health sector, different technologies, and existing studies to be able to say something about the potential, and to see where a game like this could fit in. In our research we discovered significant changes in the Norwegian health sector. From 1.January 2012 there has been implemented a reform, called “Samhandlingsreformen”, which has an increased focus on prevention and earlier intervention. In the work of achieving these goals welfare technology shall be implemented. Based on these findings we see a potential for the exergame that is going to be developed. Physiotherapists have a very central role in this new reform, so we see them as the right entity to contact to further discuss the potential for the exergame.  Video games have during the last 30 years become very popular all over the world. This form for entertainment meets many interests and it is used for several purposes like education and learning, exercising or just for pure fun. There has been done a great amount of research when it comes to using video games for health-related purposes, and the conclusion in many of these studies is that use of video games for exercise can have a positive health effect. There have been few studies performed on elderly; however, we still believe that there is a potential market for this exergame Cyberlab is going to develop. Cyberlab has chosen to use the Microsoft Kinect sensor for their exergame. The Kinect sensor captures movement without the use of gaming consoles, which makes it appropriate for elderly to use. With free hands they can give full focus to the game. From what we have found in previous work, it seems like Kinect is the right technology to use for this exergame. Our main contribution in this assignment is to develop a business model for Cyberlab and this exergame. The business model is built upon the business model ontology defined by Alexander Osterwalder. To be able to compose a well-grounded business model we had to gather information relevant to the problem and the end user of the product. This was done by conducting interviews with physiotherapists. The interviews provided our work with highly valuable information. Based on previous work, research done, feedback from interviews and our own opinions we have worked out a suitable business model for Cyberlab. The target customer segment is physiotherapy clinics, more precise public clinics and private clinics with contribution from the government. This is an entity with close relationship to elderly and their problems. We have chosen to present Cyberlab’s exergame as; a tool with the ability to customize an exercise program and to offer an alternative, fun and motivating training method while at the same time ease the workload of the physiotherapist. The exergame shall be sold in as a part of a package consisting of the game and the Kinect sensor. It will be possible for physiotherapist to request additional hardware needed and services like delivery and installation help. We have estimated Cyberlab’s cost and revenue, and from this we recommend a suitable revenue model. Our choice fell on a usage fee model, where the customers pay a low start price for the package and an additional fee every time the product is used. There is some uncertainty related to this exergame since it has not been developed, and since the idea of using video games as equipment used in physiotherapy is a relatively new phenomenon.  However, there is much that suggests that this exergame has potential. Our financial analysis also provides great possibility for this to be a profitable project for Cyberlab.

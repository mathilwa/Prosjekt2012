\begin{abstract}
In today's society we are facing a huge amount of elderly with physical health problems. Many of these problems are related to decrease in physical strength and balance, which lead to decreased mobility and high risk of falling.  Falls are a serious event for elderly because it might lead to reduced quality of life due to inactivity, loneliness, loss of self-confidence and depression. The worst outcome is death. The different outcomes of a fall can also be costly for the society. Based on the problem of falls, there has been started an EU-funded project, called "GameUp". The goal of this project is to use technology to encourage elderly to become more physically active.  One of the participants in this project is Cyberlab, a company located in Trondheim. Their role is to develop a game for exercise and rehabilitation for elderly, by using the Microsoft Kinect sensor for Windows. In this assignment we will analyse the business potential of this game. To be able to see where this game could fit, research on relevant topics have been conducted, like the Norwegian health sector, and what solutions to the fall problem that exist today. We will also look at different technologies relevant for the game, and review research that have already been done on the use of games for exercise and rehabilitation. In the research conducted we found that the new reform, "Samhandlingsreformen", introduce a new focus in the Norwegian health sector, which involves increased focus on prevention and early intervention. In the work of achieving these goals welfare technology shall be implemented where possible. We observed that physiotherapists have an essential role in this new reform. There have been done a great amount of research when it comes to using video games for health-related purposes, and the conclusion in many of these studies is that use of video games for exercise can have a positive health effect. Previous research also suggest that video games may have potential for rehabilitation. However, there is a need for customized games for elderly, as the commercial games are not made for their needs. Cyberlab has chosen to use the Microsoft Kinect sensor for their exergame. We support this choice as this technology is proved to accurately measure body movements viable for clinical practice. In addition, the convenience of not having to hold on to any controllers is an advantage for the elderly population. To analyse the business potential for this game we used Alexander Osterwalder's Business Model Ontology. To be able to build the business model, interviews with three different physiotherapists were conducted. From this, we build a business model around the customer segment:  public physiotherapy clinics and private physiotherapy clinics with contribution from the government. The value proposition Cyberlab can offer this customer segment is: a tool with the ability to customize an exercise program and to offer an alternative, fun and motivating training method while at the same time ease the workload of the physiotherapist. A financial analysis is provided, where an appropriate pricing model is proposed. The chosen model is an usage fee model, which involves the user paying a low initial price for the game and an additional fee for the time used playing the game. We found that this pricing model generated the largest profit based on an estimated market of 400 physiotherapy clinics. There are uncertainties related to this exergame. However, with support in the Norwegian health sector's new focus we evaluate the exergame to have a successful market potential. Our financial analysis also suggest this project to have economic potential.

\chapter*{Preface}
This thesis is written as a project assignment submitted to the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) as a part of our master degree in Communication Technology, Tele-economics. 
We would like to thank our professor Harald Øverby for valuable feedback, guidance and ideas on our work. We will also thank our supervisor, Tor Ivar Eikaas from Cyberlab, for providing us with information about the project, the exergame, and the company. His guidance has been very helpful. We would like to thank the three physiotherapists who were willing to let us interview them. They all provided us with highly useful information. The information we gathered have made it possible for us to give Cyberlab a well-grounded evaluation of their project.  
Finally, we will thank each other for good team-work and collaboration during the semester. It has been a good experience!

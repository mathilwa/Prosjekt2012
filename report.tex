\chapter*{Problem Description} 
Games are becoming more and more important in the health sector. One specific genre of games is exercise games (exergames). In this assignment we will focus on the business opportunities and economics of games in the health sector, with special focus on exergames for rehabilitation and elderly. The work has been done in collaboration with Cyberlab, a company focusing on serious games for education and training. The work will provide background information and input to an EU funded project focusing on elderly afraid of falling.

In particular, the following studies will be done: 
\begin{itemize}
\renewcommand{\labelitemi}{$\bullet$}
\item A background study of exergames in general and exergames for rehabilitation and elderly in particular.
\item	A description of specific business cases.
\item	Analyzing the business potential of this type of games in the health sector using Osterwalder business model.
\item	Miscellaneous aspects to consider about this type of game
\end{itemize}

\chapter*{Abstract}
A major problem in the society today is the decrease in the health in elderly. Reduction of physically strength and balance can result in falls or increased fair of falling. A fall might not sound like a serious event, but it is actually the main reason for injuries in elderly. Falling can lead to reduced quality of life because of inactivity, loneliness, loss of self-confidence and depression. The worst outcome of falls is death. As much as 25 percent of elderly falling and getting hip-fracture dies within a year. The problem of falls also results in high cost for the government. Based on this there has been started an EU-funded project that shall use technology to encourage elderly to become more physically active.  The participants in this project are entities from several countries. One of the participants is Cyberlab, a small company situated in Trondheim. Cyberlab’s part in this project is to develop an exercise game based on video game technology with the use of Microsoft Kinect.  The exercise game, from now on called exergame, shall be used for training and rehabilitation for elderly. Our contribution in this assignment is to discover the business potential for this exergame. We did a brief research of the health sector, different technologies, and existing studies to be able to say something about the potential, and to see where this game could fit in. In our research we discovered significant changes in the Norwegian health sector. From 1.January 2012 there has been implemented a reform, called “Samhandlingsreformen”, which has an increased focus on prevention, earlier intervention and closer collaboration between entities in the health sector. In the work of achieving these goals welfare technology shall be implemented. Based on these findings we see a potential for the exergame that is going to be developed. Physiotherapists have a very central role in this new reform, so we see them as the right entity to contact to further discuss the potential for the exergame.  Video games have since the first game was developed in 1952 become very popular all over the world. This form for entertainment meets many interests and it is used for several purposes like education and learning, exercising or just for pure fun. There is a lot of activity in the research field when it comes to using video games for health-related purposes, and a great amount of the studies done concludes that use of video games for exercise can have a positive health effect. However, few of the studies done are performed on elderly. Based on the earlier studies, we believe that there is a potential market for this exergame Cyberlab is going to develop. Cyberlab has chosen to use the Microsoft Kinect sensor for their exergame. This is a technology that captures movement without the use of gaming consoles, which makes it appropriate for elderly to use. With free hand they can give full focus to the game. Based on our research view it seems like Kinect is the right technology to use for this exergame. The business model for this exergame is built upon the business model ontology defined by Alexander Osterwalder. To be able to compose a well-grounded business model for Cyberlab we had to gather information relevant for the problem and the end user of the product. This was done by conduction interviews with physiotherapists. These interviews provided our work with highly valuable information. Based on previous work, research done, feedback from interviews and our own opinions we have worked out a suitable business model for Cyberlab. The target customer segment is physiotherapy clinics, more precise public clinics and private clinics with contribution from the government. We have chosen to present Cyberlab’s exergame as; a tool with the ability to customize an exercise program and to offer an alternative, fun and motivating training method while at the same time ease the workload of the physiotherapist. The exergame shall be sold in as a part of a package consisting of the game and the Kinect sensor. In addition it will be possible for physiotherapist to request additional hardware needed and services like delivery and installation help. We have estimated Cyberlab’s cost and revenue, and from this we recommend a suitable revenue model. Our choice fell on a usage fee model, where the customers pay a low start price for the package and an additional fee every time the product is used. There is some uncertainty related to this exergame since it has not been developed, and since the idea of using video games as equipment used in physiotherapy is a relatively new phenomenon.  However, there is much that suggests that this exergame has potential. Our financial analysis also provides great possibility for this to be a profitable project for Cyberlab.

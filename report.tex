\begin{abstract}
In today's society we are facing a huge amount of elderly with physical health problems. These problems are related to decrease in physical strength and balance, which lead to decreased mobility and high risk of falling.  Falls are a serious event for elderly because it might lead to  reduced quality of life because of inactivity, loneliness, loss of self-confidence and depression. It can also result in death. The different outcomes of a fall might also be costly for the society. Based on the  problem of falls, there has been started an EU-funded project were the goal is to use technology to encourage elderly to become more physically active.  One of the participants in this project is Cyberlab. Their role is to develop a game for exercise and rehabilitation for elderly, for the Microsoft Kinect sensor for Windows. This game will be made for elderly to use for exercising and rehabilitation. aIn this assignment we will analyse the business potential of this game. To be able to see where this game could git, we have done research on the topics relevant, like the Norwegian health sector, what solutions to the fall problem exist today, different technologies relevant for the game, and what research have been done on this topic.   In our research we discovered significant changes in the Norwegian health sector. A new reform, "Samhandlingsreformen", introduce a new focus. Now it will be increased focus on prevention and early intervention.  In the work of achieving these goals welfare technology shall be implemented where possible. We observed that physiotherapists have an essential role in this new reform. Video games have during the last 30 years become very popular all over the world. This form for entertainment meets many interests and it is used for several purposes like education and learning, exercising or just for pure fun. There has been done a great amount of research when it comes to using video games for health-related purposes, and the conclusion in many of these studies is that use of video games for exercise can have a positive health effect, but there is a need for customized games for elderly, as the commercial games are not made for rehabilitation in this group. Cyberlab has chosen to use the Microsoft Kinect sensor for their exergame. We support this choice as this technology is proved to accurately measure body movements viable for clinical practice. In addition, the convenience of not having to hold on to any controllers is an advantage for the elderly population. From this we know that exergames may have an potential as a rehabilitation tool and that it fits well into the work of physiotherapists. To analyse the business potential of this game we used Osterwalder Business Model Ontology. To be able to build the business model interviews of three different physiotherapists were conducted. From this, we build a business model around the customer segment: public physiotherapy clinics and private physiotherapy clinics with contribution from the government. The value proposition Cyberlab can offer this customer segment is: \emph{a tool with the ability to customize an exercise program and to offer an alternative, fun and motivating training method while at the same time ease the workload of the physiotherapist.} A financial analysis is provided, where a appropriate pricing model is proposed. The proposed pricing model is \emph{usage fee}, which involves the user paying a low initial price for the game and an additional fee for the time used playing the game. We found this pricing model to generate the largest profit based on an estimated market potential of 400 physiotherapy clinics. There are some uncertainties related to this exergame. However, with support in the Norwegian health sector's new focus, as well as a successful financial analysis, we evaluate the exergame to have a successful market potential.

\chapter*{Preface}
This thesis is written as a project assignment submitted to the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) as a part of our master degree in Communication Technology, Tele-economics. 
We would like to thank our professor Harald Øverby for valuable feedback, guidance and ideas on our work. We will also thank our supervisor, Tor Ivar Eikaas from Cyberlab's, for providing us with information about the project, the exergame, and the company. His guidance has been very helpful. We would like to thank our interviewees who spent their time answering our questions. They all provided us with highly useful information. The information we gathered has made it possible for us to give Cyberlab a well-grounded evaluation of their project.  
Finally, we will thank each other for good team-work and collaboration during the semester. It has been a good experience!

\chapter{Introduction}
The background and motivation for this project assignment is an EU-funded project, called "GameUp". The purpose of "GameUp" is to use technologies that are proved to improve motivation to encourage elderly to be more physically active. The goal is to sustain and enhance mobility in older people so they can live longer at home which may result in a better quality of life. As a part of this, they will develop convenient and easy to use exercise games and social games using low cost motion sensors and commercial modules and products \cite{gameup}.\\ \\ The project is an European cooperation with different partners involved. Cyberlab is one of them. This is a company in Trondheim working with development of simulators and simulation-based games primarily for technical education and training, but also for promotion and exemplification of technical products and services \cite{cyberlab}. Their responsibility in the GameUp project is to develop the necessary exergames using Microsoft Kinect as a sensor and input device. The games will be made with special focus on elderly who is afraid of falling. In addtion, Cyberlab is responsible for the exploitation tasks of the project.  \\ \\

\section{Contribution}
Our contribution in this project is a thorough analysis of the business opportunities of Cyberlabâ€™s exergame. As a part of this we will provide a financial analysis of the project. Our results will be based on previous work, our own opinions and interviews conducted by ourselves. This project is meant to serve as a guideline for Cyberlab, and will hopefully provide them with valuable work.  

\section{Scope and Limitation}
This is an EU-funded project, meaning that the product Cyberlab is going to develop can possible be sold all over Europe. We have limited our project to only look at the Norwegian market, with starting point in Trondheim. Selling this product in other countries might be very different, and will require a different business model. Another limitation is that we had to base our assumptions and conclusions upon information gathered from a limited amount of interviews conducted in Trondheim, this might have made our data incomplete.  One of the biggest limitations in this project is that the game is not developed yet. This limits our ability to understand the game properly. The market we have observed is very immature when it comes to technology. With incomplete information, it was impossible to predict a demand for the game. blabla..
